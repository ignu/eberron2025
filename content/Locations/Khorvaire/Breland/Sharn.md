#### TumbleDown

Tumbledown is the most decrepit district in Middle Dura, where ramshackle tenements are perpetually collapsing and being hastily rebuilt atop their own ruins, creating a chaotic labyrinth of precarious structures joined by makeshift bridges and rope walkways. Despite occasional Watch patrols providing minimal security, the impoverished residents live in a constant cycle of architectural entropy, rebuilding their crumbling homes with whatever materials they can salvage, their resilience a stark contrast to the mold-covered walls and cracked foundations that surround them.

##### Half Pint Tavern

Tucked away in thedepths of Middle Dura, the Half-Pint Tavern is deliberately unremarkable. Its exterior is scarred, the painted sign bearing its name long faded, giving it an air of weary anonymity. It caters to the local laborers and residents, offering basic fare and drink without fanfare. Its Karrnathi owner, Kyvle Trothut, is known to be pragmatic; for the right price, he'll even leave the keys for patrons desiring absolute privacy, returning only in the morning.
#### Bazaar

The largest marketplace in Sharn, a maze of shops, stalls, and vendors selling goods from across Khorvaire and beyond. Known for its colorful atmosphere and opportunities for both legitimate shopping and less-than-legal acquisitions.
