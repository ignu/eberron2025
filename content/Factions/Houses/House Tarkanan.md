House Tarkanan is an underground criminal organization in Eberron made up of people with aberrant dragonmarks, which are considered dangerous and unpredictable compared to the true dragonmarks controlled by the dragonmarked houses. Named after the infamous Lord Halas Tarkanan who led the War of the Mark against the dragonmarked houses centuries ago, they operate primarily in Sharn as thieves, assassins, and mercenaries, providing sanctuary to those with aberrant marks while using their unpredictable magical abilities for criminal enterprises.
