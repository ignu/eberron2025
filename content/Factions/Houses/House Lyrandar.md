> "Sovereigns and firstborn, grant me the four blessings promised to our people: dominion over the air, dominion over the water, fortune for my family, and fortune for my future."

> â€”From the Oath of Lyrandar

A half-elven dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire with its enclave located on [[Stormhome]] an island city-state just north of [[Aundair]].

As is common among other dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar is led by a baron (patriarch or matriarch), currently [[Esravash d'Lyrandar]]. Some in the house refer to the baron as "Firstborn", believing that Lyran and Selavash, the ancient ancestors of House Lyrandar and the spiritual ancestors of the Khoravar race, speak through that individual.

## The Raincaller's Guild

The Raincaller's Guild consists of House Lyrandar heirs who possess the Mark of Storm and specialize in weather manipulation. These talented dragonmarked members use their abilities to provide essential weather control services across Khorvaire. From ensuring proper rainfall for farming communities to clearing storm clouds for important events, Raincallers are vital to agricultural prosperity and safe maritime travel. The guild maintains a careful balance of providing services while respecting natural weather patterns, operating with a philosophy that weather should be guided rather than dominated.

## The Windwright's Guild

The Windwright's Guild manages House Lyrandar's extensive air and sea transportation network. Guild members pilot the magnificent elemental airships and galleons that have revolutionized travel across Eberron. These skilled navigators harness elemental binding techniques and their Mark of Storm abilities to control the vessels with precision. Their services range from luxurious passenger flights to critical supply deliveries, connecting the Five Nations and beyond with unparalleled efficiency.

## Sela's Path

Sela's Path is the priesthood of House Lyrandar. The cult reveres Arawai, Kol Korran, Lyran, and Selavash. Its adherents maintain that the souls of the firstborn serve as intermediaries between the Khoravar and the Sovereign Host, just as Tira Miron is said to speak for the Silver Flame.

## Lyran's Gift

Lyran's Gift is the arcane research arm of the house. The Gift helps Lyrandar spellcasters hone their skills, and it works in concert with House Cannith and the Twelve to develop new forms of magic.

## The Storm Front

The Storm Front is rumored to be a cult operating within House Lyrandar whose members believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of Arawai and Kol Korran but the mark of the Devourer. Cult members maintain that the greatest members of the house live on as krakens in the deep, and that these immortal elders guide the Storm Front through visions. 

### Secrets and Conflicts
- **Sovereignty**: The underlying ambition for political power or even nationhood is a driving force, potentially putting them at odds with the established nations and the Treaty of Thronehold.
- **Elemental Deals**: The nature of the agreements binding elementals to their ships is sometimes questioned. Are the elementals willing partners, slaves, or something else? This could lead to conflict with elemental beings or druidic sects.
- **Monopoly Enforcement**: Lyrandar ruthlessly protects its monopolies. They might sabotage competitors, engage in corporate espionage against Orien, or use political pressure to maintain their dominance.
- **Weather Weaponization**: The potential to use the Mark of Storm offensively is significant. While the Raincallers Guild focuses on agriculture, darker elements might sell destructive weather services or use them for the House's own ends.
