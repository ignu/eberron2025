A half-elven dragonmarked house throughout Khorvaire with its enclave located on Stormhome an island city-state just north of [[Aundair]].

As is common among other dragonmarked houses, Lyrandar is led by a baron (patriarch or matriarch). Some in the house refer to the baron as "Firstborn", believing that Lyran and Selavash, the ancient ancestors of House Lyrandar and the spiritual ancestors of the Khoravar race, speak through that individual.

### Secrets and Conflicts
- **Sovereignty**: The underlying ambition for political power or even nationhood is a driving force, potentially putting them at odds with the established nations and the Treaty of Thronehold.
- **Elemental Deals**: The nature of the agreements binding elementals to their ships is sometimes questioned. Are the elementals willing partners, slaves, or something else? This could lead to conflict with elemental beings or druidic sects.
- **Monopoly Enforcement**: Lyrandar ruthlessly protects its monopolies. They might sabotage competitors, engage in corporate espionage against Orien, or use political pressure to maintain their dominance.
- **Weather Weaponization**: The potential to use the Mark of Storm offensively is significant. While the Raincallers Guild focuses on agriculture, darker elements might sell destructive weather services or use them for the House's own ends.
## The Raincaller's Guild

The Raincaller's Guild consists of House Lyrandar heirs who possess the Mark of Storm and specialize in weather manipulation. These talented dragonmarked members use their abilities to provide essential weather control services across Khorvaire. From ensuring proper rainfall for farming communities to clearing storm clouds for important events, Raincallers are vital to agricultural prosperity and safe maritime travel. The guild maintains a careful balance of providing services while respecting natural weather patterns, operating with a philosophy that weather should be guided rather than dominated.

## The Windwright's Guild

The Windwright's Guild manages House Lyrandar's extensive air and sea transportation network. Guild members pilot the magnificent elemental airships and galleons that have revolutionized travel across Eberron. These skilled navigators harness elemental binding techniques and their Mark of Storm abilities to control the vessels with precision. Their services range from luxurious passenger flights to critical supply deliveries, connecting the Five Nations and beyond with unparalleled efficiency.
