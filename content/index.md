This is the wiki for our Eberron Campaign.

This wiki is pretty empty now, but we're looking at creating a party with [[House Lyrandar]] as a Patron

And, a link to my [[House Rules]] as a reminder. I haven't fully updated them for 2024 (just a copy/paste from Homebrewry) so I might have to take a second look at the optional DMG actions I have listed.
