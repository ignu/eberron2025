Baron Esravash is one of the youngest matriarchs in the history of House Lyrandar. She had her seat of power on [[Stormhome]], an island just north of the coast of [[Aundair]]. The once-desolate island has been transformed by [[House Lyrandar|Lyrandar]] mages and is now a popular resort destination as well as the home of Esravash.

Esravash directs both the [[House Lyrandar#The Raincaller's Guild|Raincaller's Guild]] and the [[House Lyrandar#The Windwright's Guild|Windwright's Guild]] from her island home on Stormhome.

Esravash is sometimes referred to as "**Firstborn**", for members believe that Lyran and Selavash speak through the house leaders. She also claims the title of baron, and matriarch.
