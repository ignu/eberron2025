After [[Taarkhan]] grapples her, the party interrogates her (mostly asking her name repeatedly) and she explains she is being paid by a "bad smelling man" to look out for people asking about the mask.

[[Taarkhan]] offers alternative employment looking out for a few issues worrying him, while [[Pallas]] intimidates her with a crossbow and [[Cas]] tries to get her to reveal PII which makes [[Rhazala]] worry about identity theft.

She agrees to [[Taarkhan|Taarkhan's]] terms, and reveals the smelly cultist is at The Silvermist Theater.

The party go to the theater with [[Cas]] entering disguised as [[Rhazala]]. The party discuss code words Cas can say, with [[Coravash]] offending [[Pallas]] with some bird calls.

Once inside [[Cas]]/[[Rhazala]] see a cultist start a ritual over the unconscious[[Drevan d'Lyrandar | Drevan]], she screams the code word and the party barges in slaying the cultists in a brutal battle.

When the leader, a warforged named Echo, falls a silver metal sphere erupts from his chest and streaks toward the door. His voice booms throughout the theater: **"THE SHAPER OF NIGHTMARES WILL ENSURE MY RETURN AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE IN YOUR PAIN!"**

[[Barbara]] apologizes to all the dead bodies, revealing her unexpected lack of prejudice against warforged.

When Drevan is healed, he explains that he heard the cultists discussing that his wife, Nora, paid to have him murdered. A recovered note confirms a thousand galifar contract.

[[Coravash]] apologies to [[Pallas]] for her racist, anti-Kenku bird calls.

After some legal advice from [[Pallas]], [[Drevan d'Lyrandar|Drevan's]] frantic Sending to his banker unveils further betrayal: Nora has already emptied their vault of a mysterious golden book covered in indecipherable script, all their gold, and their shares in [[Aminat Materials]]
