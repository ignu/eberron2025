[[Cas]] casts command on the goblin girl running with the mask and forces her to stop.

Her name is [[Rhazala]] even if no one in the party remembers. She's seven which is late teens in goblin years.

After [[Taarkhan]] grapples her, the party interrogates her (mostly about her name) and she explains she was being paid by a "bad smelling man" to keep a look out for people asking about the mask.

The letter confirms [[Cas]]'s suspicions about Drevan's troubled marriage, revealing his wife had commissioned his assassination. The Party discovers she likely withdrew funds from their shared vault to finance the plot, intending to inherit his estate upon his death. [[Pallas]] offers Drevan legal counsel on protecting his remaining assets from his wife's claims. [[Barbara]], drawing parallels to her own marital difficulties, suggests there might be understandable motivations behind his wife's extreme actions.

With Drevan now safely recovered but badly injured, The Party seeks a secure location to rest and recuperate. [[Coravash]] apologizes to [[Pallas]] for making offensive bird-like sounds earlier. As they make their way toward the Lyrandar enclave with a disguised Drevan, he shares critical information with [[Pallas]] and [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa]]: he had uncovered a remarkable artifactâ€”a golden book inscribed with an untranslatable script that had confounded scholars. He reveals that his wife has emptied their vault, taking not only the mysterious book and their gold, but also all of his valuable shares in Amanat Materials.
