3. The goblin teenage girl, Rosala, is running away from us but Cas casts Command to force her to stop. She takes the mask back when Taarkhan grapples her. The girl tells us that someone was asking around about people who would be carrying the mask - an unnamed guy who was paying her 10g. She thought she’d get more if she stole the mask. The guy she spoke with smelled bad - exactly like the glamerweave that we found. He was wearing the same theater mask when he contracted her. Taarkhan contracts the goblin girl with 15g to look for people from Carnath that are looking for Barbara or Taarkhan. He also wants intel about any goblins who aren’t acting right. Palace shows Rosala his crossbow and threatens her and it’s scary and awful. Cas shifts to look just like Rosala because she wants to impersonate Rosala to the group. We learn that the bad-smelling guy is at the Silvermist Theater. Cas tells Rosala that if she proves good at spying and keeps herself alive for a while, she can potentially find a job/friends at House Phiarlan. We find out that Barbara has a very bad relationship with her husband who she hasn’t seen in 10 years. Cas goes to the Silvermist theater disguised as Rosala and reports that the mask was being carried by the two guards we saw. There’s a group of 5 standing by the stage with an unconscious half elf on the table on the stage. They seem a little freaked that the guards have the mask, but they need to start “the ritual” so they carry ahead and are about to stab the unconscious man.

    Cas says the code phrase that the group agreed on and everyone busts in to save the day. Combat ensues. We don’t do awesome in combat because we’re little weak weanies, but we beat the group. The bad-smelling leader was a Warforged and had this crazy-looking orb thing flew out. We heard his voice say that the creator of nightmares will make us regret this (paraphrased). Barbara turns out to be super sad about death and apologizes to all of the dead bodies that she slew. We did find out that Barbara doesn’t have a problem with Warforged (Ryan goes into a theoretical ethical debate about whether Warforged have souls/their existence). We find:
    
    - 58g
    - Warforged guy had an obsidian dagger with a shard of something in the hilt, worth 150g (likely ornamental)
    - Wand of entanglement
    - Gold ring with a pearl that’s worth 100g
    - A letter on the Warforged saying that he needs to kill Drevin the next time he visits the Half Pint for the payment of 1000g

    CAS WAS RIGHT, HIS MARRIAGE WASN’T GOOD AND HIS WIFE IS THE ONE WHO HIRED THEM TO KILL DREVIN. ULTIMATE VINDICATION. It turns out that his wife may have taken money out of their vault to do this. His wife would inherit his money upon his death, but we’re not 100% sure if that’s the motive behind her death. Palace tells him about legal matters and how to protect his assets from his wife. Barbara projects her own marriage woes onto Drevin’s marriage and tells him that there’s not always a bad reason to try to kill your husband. Drevin’s wife has already taken all of their money from the vault. We look for a place to rest, heal up, and stash Drevin. Coravash apologizes to Palace for making very racist bird calls. On the way to the enclave, we’ve got Drevin disguised and we’re walking pretty injured. Drevin looks at Palace and Iansa and says that he found a contact about a very strange artifact - a gold book with an incomprehensible script that no scholars could figure out. The vault had the book, the gold, and all of his shares in Amanat Materials.
