After [[Taarkhan]] grapples her, the party interrogates her (mostly asking her name repeatedly) and she explains she is being paid by a "bad smelling man" to look out for people asking about the mask.

[[Taarkhan]] offers her alternative employment looking out for a few issues worrying him, while [[Pallas]] intimidates her with a crossbow and [[Cas]] tries to get her to reveal PII which makes [[Rhazala]] worry about identity theft.

She agrees to the terms, and reveals the smelly cultist is at The Silvermist Theater.

The party go to the theater with [[Cas]] entering disguised as [[Rhazala]]. The party discuss code words Cas can say, with [[Coravash]] offending [[Pallas]] with some bird calls.

Once inside [[Cas]]/[[Rhazala]] see a cultist start a ritual over the unconscious[[Drevan d'Lyrandar | Drevan]], she screams the code word and the party barges in slaying the cultists in a brutal battle.

When the main one, a warforged named Echo, dies, a silver metal ball erupts from his chest and quickly flies out the door. The words **“The Shaper of Nightmares will ensure my return and I will have my vengeance in your pain!”** boom in the theater in his voice.

[[Barbara]] apologizes to all the dead bodies and it's revealed she has no problems with warforged.

When Drevan is healed, he explains that he heard the cultists discussing that his wife, Nora, paid to have him murdered. (They also found a note showing a payment of 1000gp).

After some legal advice from [[Pallas]], [[Drevan d'Lyrandar|Drevan]] Sendings his banker and learns that Nora was already at his vault, taking out an artifact (a gold book with indecipherable script), all his gold and their shares in [[Aminat Materials]]
