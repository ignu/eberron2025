## Chateau the Canary and Fizzbang

The party decides to keep their stolen tentacled canary in the basement, naming it **Chateau**.

[[Cas]] visits the marketplace to collect her reward from [[Spyder]] for bribing the guard, and heads to Bang & Boom Pyrotechnics. She trades some of her [[Nix "Three Fingers"#Absinthian Mushrooms|Absinthian Mushrooms]] for a huge rocket while making a date with the gnome the shopkeeper, **Fizzbang Sparklelighter** the following evening.

## The Iron King's Bargain

On the way to the [[Sharn#The Cogs|Cogs]], a girl named **Anna** attempts to pickpocket [[Pallas]] but trips, dropping a shopping list containing components needed to repair a damaged Warforged. Anna explains that her sick friend **Max** is being held by "the Iron King" in [[Sharn#The Cogs|the Cogs]], who promised to cure Max in exchange for help gathering repair materials.

Concerned about Max's deteriorating condition, [[Cas]] offers to help stabilize the girl. The party follows Anna into an abandoned junkyard, though [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa]] remains outside due to "Keep Out" signs that [[Pallas]]'s attempt to change to "Welcome" fails to convince her to ignore.

## The Colossus

Inside the junkyard, they discover "The Iron King", a Warforged Colossus missing every limb save one pincer arm. He still believes the Last War is ongoing and reminisces about fighting for Breland under General Dane and discusses the war with [[Taarkhan]].

Anna's friend Max lies critically ill (with Filth Fever) and is strapped to a makeshift hospital bed beneath the towering Warforged. After tense negotiations, [[Cas]] successfully convinces the Iron King to allow her to stabilize the dying girl with herbal remedies. [[Taarkhan]] asserts authority over the group of children hiding in the area, though the Iron King refuses to release Anna until his repairs are completed.

The party manages to negotiate the release of the sick children, with Taarkhan making very strong appeals to his sense of military duty.  [[Barbara]] then escorts them to [[Granny Labeth|Stonebridge Orphanage]]. 

## Infiltrating the Creation Forge

With the children safe, the party ventures deeper into [[Sharn#The Cogs|the Cogs]] to the "Fellows" of Shaped Nightmares' hideout at the abandoned creation forge. [[Cas]] disguises herself as **Mirin** while the rest of the party positions themselves in nearby alleys as backup.

Using the password *"Fear reveals truth,"* [[Cas]] is let in to the compound where she commiserates over how crazy the auction was the night before with a fellow cultist, but kept slipping into her dreams which seem to merge with reality here.

As she's escorted to Echo, she stumbles on a ritual. Most of the cultists are gathered around the sleeping cultist (the same one who absconded with the book), and Cas is informed this ritual is ferrying an Inspired to Eberron, all possible thanks to the "Dreamer" they captured who is integral in bridging the the veil between Dal Quor and the material world.

Not very interested, Cas is laser-focused on the the golden book. She grabs it and makes her dramatic escape by detonating the massive firework, blinding all the cultists as she sprints out of the compound.
