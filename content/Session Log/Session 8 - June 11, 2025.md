Following [[Cas]]'s dramatic firework explosion at the cultist lair, the party flees the compound with book in hand. The cultists give pursuit, but they're unable to make headway into [[Iansa d'Lyrandar]]'s wind.

They discover the book is written in some corrupted version of Draconic that proves difficult to decipher and leaves readers feeling drained.

The party relocates Chateau to the attic of a [[House Phiarlan]] safe house. [[Cas]] arranges for a House bard to communicate with the creature, discovering its enthusiasm for its role as a corpse disposal system. Cas finds employment for Chateau doing exactly that.

When Cas collects her gold reward from Spyder for the guard bribery, she receives disturbing news: **Daask has placed a 10,000 gold bounty** on the heads of [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa]], [[Taarkhan]], and [[Pallas]].

Reuniting to plan their next moves, the party attempts to understand the golden book's significance. [[Coravash]] discovers the tome resists all attempts at destruction, it won't burn or be damaged by conventional means.

The party consults [[Torsten d'Lyrandar]] about the mysterious tome. Despite his knowledge of Draconic, even Torsten finds reading the book exhausting. He suggests taking it to two potential experts:

* **Professor Cavelanleal**: A learned sage who trades translations for his next magical fixâ€”unpredictable but knowledgeable
* **Lady Valarathorn**: A mysterious figure who deals in the memories of the dead, selling enchanted masks that allow wearers to experience historical events through deceased eyes. She supposedly possesses a Draconic mask thousands of years old
