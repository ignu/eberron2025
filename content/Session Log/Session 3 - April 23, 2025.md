## The Search for Nora

Walking back to [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa's]] place, [[Drevan d'Lyrandar]] tells the story of discovering the mysterious book in an expedition to [[Xen'drik]] and mentions his wife's brother,  [[Klaut Irvallo]].

After sleeping at [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa's]], they head to Drevan's in [[Sharn#Upper Northedge|Upper Northedge]] to find his mansion ransacked. Norah's closet has been systematically emptied while Drevan's clothes were tossed all over the room. [[Cas]], thinking ahead, collects samples of handwriting and a wax seal for future identity theft. Their only lead appears to be a business card for an establishment called "Bartering Bessa's."
## The Bazaar, Bessa's Bargains and Buying drugs

Entering the [[Sharn#Bazaar|Bazaar]] in Middle Dura, the group is approached by a halfling named [[Nix "Three Fingers"]], who offers to "expand their horizons". Despite the group's disapproval, Cas purchases some [[Nix "Three Fingers"#Absinthian Mushrooms|Absinthian Mushrooms]] from him. [[Barbara]] locates Bessa's shop while [[Coravash]] unsuccessfully lobbies Cas to return her purchase.

At Bessa's, Bessa claims ignorance about the gold book, but her deception is noticed by [[Taarkhan]] and Cas. Taking Cas aside, they cast `Locate Object` but fail to detect the book nearby. 

When confronted, Bessa admits that Norah sold her the book last night, and mentioned Norah seemed off. She was mumbling and constantly pinching herself.

Bessa also reveals that someone from [[House Tarkanan]] purchased the book from her this morning, she believes he will auction it at one of his elite illicit underground auctions. 

Bessa mentions a regular customer named Spyder who may know its details.
## Honest Faces

The group ventures into an area frequented by Changelings, where Coravash makes an awkward social blunder by assuming Cas might be a Changeling due to her frequently changing appearance.

Inside the cosmetic shop Honest Faces, they meet Spyder, who demonstrates his shapeshifting abilities by taking Iansa's form. Spyder mentions an auction run by [[Jolgar]] and offers to reveal its location in exchange for delivering a package to Stonebridge Orphanage.
## Stonebridge Orphanage

While approaching their destination, they encounter orphans who are encouraging a Kenku child to repeat swear words. Cas tries to entertain them with a magic trick, though frustratingly receives little appreciation from her audience.

When crossing the final bridge towards Stonebridge, two harpies fly out from a rooftop and start singing at the group. Iansa falls under their trance and starts walking toward the edge.
