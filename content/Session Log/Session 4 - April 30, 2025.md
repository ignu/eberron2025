A moment before stepping over the edge of the bridge, [[Iansa d'Lyrandar]] shakes off the harpy's influence. The party opens fire, causing the harpies to flee, and Iansa manages a fatal lightning blow on one of them, while the survivor screams that Daask will have its revenge.

They head to Stonebridge Orphanage where Granny Labeth accepts the package, for which [[Pallas]] makes her sign a receipt. She gifts them with two "special" cookies (effectively a healing potion) but [[Cas]] immediately eats one hoping they're actually drugs. Having their heart-strings pulled by "Rawr" (the loudest shifter roar-er) and other orphans, Iansa donates 40gp to them.

They return to Spyder with the receipts and learn the auction is tonight, right down the street at The Mad Warlock's tower. It's invite only, and they don't have an invite. They learn about some of the guests, one being a boisterous dwarf named Thaddeus who likes to drink at The Happy Minotaur.

At the tavern, they find about 20 patrons but no sign of Thaddeus. They discover a back hallway called "The Labyrinth" and learn from the bartender that it contains private booths for various activities. They enter , with [[Barbara]] sneaking and peering into the various booths. Barbara drunkenly stumbles upon two identical, attractive half-elves engaged in intimate activity. Barbara, quite intoxicated, tells Cas about the men, and Cas takes mental notes.

Meanwhile, [[Iansa]] and Pallas approach the dwarf's booth, offering a round of free drinks to celebrate their "successful business deal." Thaddeus's group seems wary but accepts the drinks. When asked about their evening plans, Thaddeus mentions the exclusive auction, showing off a fancy ancient ring from a previous purchase. Iansa and Pallas attempt to flatter their way into getting an invitation. Thaddeus invites Iansa to join him and provides her with an invite. Pallas awkwardly leaves Iansa alone with Thaddeus, creating an unexpected date-like situation while he returns to update the rest of the party.

Iansa examines the invitation and asks Thaddeus for advice on social climbing in the city. He offers suggestions about meeting influential people and making connections, mentioning that she's new to town. The group successfully forges a copy of the invitation and prepares to attend. Cas helps disguise Barbara to prevent recognition by Thaddeus's group.

Before departing, Cas disguises herself to look like one of the identical half-elves from earlier and asks them if they're "looking for a third?". After one excitedly expresses interest and the other mentions an additional fee, she excuses herself.

The party arrives at the tower where the auction is being held. They gain entry without issue, encountering a disgruntled guard whom Cas presents with a flower purchased from the marketplace.

Inside, they observe bizarre items for sale, including a canary in a gilded birdcage with tentacles protruding from its mouth, a sphere inscribed with ancient Giant script, and an ornate vanity mirror studded with dragon shards. The mirror causes [[Coravash]] to fail a constitution saving throw, resulting in her dream self, Vash, experiencing a wave of terror and taking damage.
