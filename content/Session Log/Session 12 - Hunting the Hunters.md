Back at the safe house, [[Barbara]] tells the group about seeing her husband, [[Baron Vorik Kessler]] (a high-ranking figure in [[Karrnath]]'s military), kill their daughter. She recounts attacking him, resulting in the scar she bears today.

Now Vorik's agents are scouring Sharn looking for her, but the party vows they won't let him take her and decide to investigate them themselves.

The party learns from [[Rhazala]] that they're staying at **The Sanguine Serpent** in [[Sharn#Middle Dura|Middle Dura]]. [[Cas]] and [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa]] disguise themselves to scout the tavern, while the others wait outside. [[Pallas]]'s disguise as a "masquerade bird" raises some eyebrows.

Inside the tavern, a dwarf becomes overly enamored with Iansa, making her uncomfortable enough to leave. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the party witnesses members of the Sharn Watch roughing up two goblins who allegedly stole a schematic from House Cannith.

The goblins, **Snerk** and **Icky**, explain that their schematic details how to weaponize **Storm Stone** into **Void Strike** ammunition. **Lady Prima d'Cannith** confiscated their plans after dismissing them as "awful," yet kept the schematics for herself rather than returning them.

[[Coravash]] attempts to calm the agitated goblins with meditation and mindful breathing. It goes about as well as expected.

[[Pallas]] sees a business opportunity and gives them his card, while [[Taarkhan]] discusses the potential military applications of StromeStone with the group.

### The Third Agent

Cas learns from the dwarf that the two agents are staying upstairs with a sailor with a long beard, eye patch, and dirty leather coat. Unlike the other two, this one seemed to be an unwelcome addition to their group.

### Operation: Sexy Invisible Cop Bird

The party decides they must retrieve the stolen schematics immediately. They devise a plan in which Cas and Pallas will infiltrate the **House Cannith** compound while invisible, with the others creating diversions outside.

Pallas transforms into what the party dubs "**Cop Bird**" before turning invisible for the infiltration.

### Sabotage and Ball Bearings

With a spectacular stealth roll of 29 (blessed by the Trickster), [[Pallas]] tailgates a gnome artificer into the compound. Inside, he finds **Lady Prima d'Cannith** in her office holding white stones and discussing bidding wars between **Karrnath** and **Thrane** over Void Strike technology.

Unable to enter the occupied office directly, Pallas employs his signature chaos tactics: sabotaging machinery with ball bearings. After the first disruption draws Lady Prima out to yell at her staff, he escalates by planting more ball bearings and a bag near a different machine, attempting to frame another engineer and start internal conflict.

### The Sailor Appears

As Pallas wreaks mechanical havoc inside House Cannith, the outside team spots the mysterious sailor agent walking down the street, setting up next session's confrontation.
