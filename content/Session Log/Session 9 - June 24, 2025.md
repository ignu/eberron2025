## Lady Valarathorn's Dilemma

The party visits Lady Valarathorn's lounge seeking the memory masks. They learn the one they're seeking, a mask belonging to an ancient dragon named [[Vvaraak]] was stolen a few days ago.

The assumed thief was **Councilor Haas**, who came to purchase a vision session but disappeared with the mask the next day. Despite her reporting this to the watch, the mask was not found.

Valarathorn offers them a deal: recover the stolen dragon mask and receive 1,000 gold, plus the opportunity to use it to understand the golden book's ancient Draconic text.

### Intelligence Gathering

The party gathers information about their target:

- Councilor Haas lives in a luxury apartment on the 42nd floor of the Platinum Spires in Upper Dura
- The building has magical wards dispelling flight
- Well-dressed, heavily-armed doormen guard the entrance
- His wife is a young mage who dropped out of Arcanix

[[Cas]]'s brother Jack provides additional intelligence, describing the councilor as "a douche" who fought in the war for political credentials. He's physically imposing and likely skilled with swords.
## The Heist

Discovering that Councilor Haas is attending a council meeting that evening, the party executes their plan:

Using a commandeered soarsled, they fly over the building, drop to the 46th floor with *Feather Fall* and rappel down the rest of the way. 

During their infiltration, Cas takes notes on other apartments for potential future "acquisitions," including fine art on the 45th floor, a tressym on the 44th floor and a party of elites on the 43rd.

## The Theft and Discovery

They find Haas' window warded, but [[Iansa]] just _Misty Steps_ inside. She retrieves Vvaraak's mask but overhears compromising sounds from the bedroom, it sounds like the councilor's wife is entertaining someone named "Cutlass."
## Vvaraak's Vision

Despite [[Pallas]]'s preference to wait for spell slot recovery, [[Iansa d'Lyrandar|Iansa]] immediately dons the ancient dragon mask.

**Her vision**: She experiences the perspective of [[Vvaraak]], a massive black dragon observing orcs engaged in conflict with aberrations. The ancient dragon's thoughts resonate with urgency: _"Someone has to do something."_
