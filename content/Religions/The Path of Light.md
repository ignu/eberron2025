The Path of Light is a religious philosophy followed primarily by the kalashtar and some humans in Eberron. It originated in the plane of [[Dal Quor]] and represents a central belief system in the struggle against the evil Dreaming Dark.

## Core Beliefs

- **il-Yannah**: Followers believe in the divine light (il-Yannah) that exists within all living beings
- **Balance and Harmony**: The path teaches that enlightenment comes through balancing the physical and spiritual self
- **Meditation**: Regular meditation practices help adherents connect with the light within
- **Non-violence**: The philosophy emphasizes peaceful resistance whenever possible
- **Righteous Action**: When necessary, followers believe in taking action against darkness, particularly the Dreaming Dark

## Kalashtar Connection

The kalashtar race are the primary practitioners of the Path of Light. They are a fusion of human and quori (dream spirits) who fled [[Dal Quor]] to escape the evil Dreaming Dark. These quori rebels, known as the good quori or the Lightspeakers, merged with willing human hosts to survive in the material plane and continue their struggle.

## Organization
